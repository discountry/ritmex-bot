# Field definitions:
# timestamp: ISO8601 time (UTC recommended)
# side: buy|sell
# price: execution price
# qty: executed quantity (base or contract units)
# fee: absolute fee amount in quote currency
# slippage_bps: slippage vs quote/mid in basis points
# pnl: realized PnL for the fill (quote currency). Use per-fill or per-cycle; be consistent
# order_type: limit|market|ioc|fok
# grid_level: integer level index of the grid at execution time
# portfolio_avg_cost: current portfolio weighted average cost (quote per unit) after the trade
# exposure_after: absolute net exposure after the trade (quote or contracts)
# spread_bps: best bid/ask spread in bps at execution time
# depth_top_quote: top-of-book depth (quote currency) at execution time
# maker_taker: maker|taker (post-only fills should be maker)
# roi_pct: portfolio ROI percentage at the time window checkpoint (optional per fill or sampled)
# drawdown_pct: portfolio drawdown percentage (optional)
# range_mid: range mid reference price (e.g., EMA or mid), at execution time
# range_lower_pct: lower bound relative to mid, as percent (negative)
# range_upper_pct: upper bound relative to mid, as percent (positive)
# step_type: fixed_pct|fixed_price|atr_ratio
# step_value: step distance value (% / price / ATR ratio), align to step_type
# grids: total number of grids configured
# post_only: true|false
# retry_count: number of post-only retries attempted for this order
# cooldown_sec: cooldown duration for same-level re-triggers

# Optional extension fields (append if needed):
# bucket_id, funding_rate, mark_price, index_price, liquidation_buffer_pct, risk_score, event_type
